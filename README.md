# just a small android app to show ttn devices on a map:
- get the devices and their locations for a given ttn app (only V2 Supported)  
- show last known location of every device as a marker on the map
- show the last locations of every device as a track
https://github.com/MatthiasHertel21/ttn-devices-on-map/blob/main/app/release/Screen_0.jpg?raw=true
- get a list of addresses for last known location of your devices (using osm address data)
https://github.com/MatthiasHertel21/ttn-devices-on-map/blob/main/app/release/Screen_1.jpg?raw=true
- you can configure the application, credentials and the "query range" in the preferences of the app

# feel free to use it as you like 
- It's just a little shot for one ttn application ... I tested it for three devices, worked ... 
- runs fine at S6 / android 6  ... no further testing
