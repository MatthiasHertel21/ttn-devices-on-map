# just a small android app to show ttn devices on a map:
- get the devices and their locations for a given ttn app (only V2 Supported)  
- show last known location of every device as a marker on the map
- show the last locations of every device as a track

# feel free to use it as you like 
- It's just a litle shot for one ttn application ... I tested it for two devices, worked ... 
- runs fine at S6 / android 6  ... no further testing
