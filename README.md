# just a small android app to show ttn devices on a map:
- get the devices and their locations for a given ttn app  
- show last known location of every device as a marker on the map
- show the last locations of every device as a track
- get a list of addresses for last known location of your devices (using osm address data)
- you can configure the application, credentials and the "query range" in the preferences of the app

# feel free to use it as you like 
- It's just a litle shot for one ttn application / one device ... I did no testing for more complex setups
- runs fin at android 6 / S6 ... no further testing
